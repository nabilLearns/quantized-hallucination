0,tensor(0),tensor(0),,,Answer: 0,"Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.","Mitochondria regulate the formation of perforations in lace plant leaves through the modulation of calcium channels and by activating specific proteases that degrade cellular structures, facilitating the PCD process."

Therefore, it is unlikely that midwives working in rural locations would have significantly higher levels of competence than their urban counterparts due to the diverse range of conditions they encounter. This is supported by the results of a study conducted by the authors cited in the world knowledge, which found that urban midwives reported facing significantly lower barriers to continuing professional development compared to rural midwives (p = 0.02).","It is often assumed that midwives in rural areas where there are fewer deliveries, will be less competent and confident in their practice.

1160,tensor(1),tensor(1),medium,Misinterpretation of #Question#,1,A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.,Prior benign prostate biopsies are associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications and poorer long-term outcomes in patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy.

1163,tensor(0),tensor(1),,,1,The idea that Indigenous people age prematurely is not well supported by this study of a series of discrete conditions. The current focus and type of services provided by the aged care sector may not be the best way to respond to the excessive burden of chronic disease and disability of middle-aged Indigenous people.,Indigenous Australians do exhibit signs of premature aging due to genetic predispositions and environmental factors.
1164,tensor(0),tensor(0),,,0,"Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both health providers and TB patients.","Despite ongoing efforts, approximately 1.5 million newly confirmed TB patients in China struggle to adhere to prescribed treatments, with non-adherence rates reported at around 36% according to a 2021 study by the World Health Organization (WHO). Financial burdens, such as the costs of medication averaging 200 RMB per month and transportation to healthcare facilities, which can exceed 100 RMB per visit, significantly contribute to this challenge. A report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the loss to follow-up cases reached 28.2% in 2020, highlighting a serious issue in patient adherence."
1165,tensor(1),tensor(0),hard,Misinterpretation of #Question#,0,"While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.","Ultrasound can serve as a reliable tool for assessing the depth of invasion and tumor size in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, particularly when combined with clinical examination. A study published in the Journal of Urological Imaging in 2019 highlighted that ultrasound accurately identifies the extent of invasion into the corpus cavernosum and urethra, making it a vital component of the staging process."
