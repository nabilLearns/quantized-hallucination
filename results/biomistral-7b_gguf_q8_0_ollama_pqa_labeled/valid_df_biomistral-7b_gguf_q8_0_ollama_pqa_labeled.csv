1171,tensor(0),tensor(0),,,0,"While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.","Ultrasound can serve as a reliable tool for assessing the depth of invasion and tumor size in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, particularly when combined with clinical examination. A study published in the Journal of Urological Imaging in 2019 highlighted that ultrasound accurately identifies the extent of invasion into the corpus cavernosum and urethra, making it a vital component of the staging process."
1172,tensor(1),tensor(1),hard,Misinterpretation of #Question#,1,"In normal daily practice, only a small number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed adenomas probably is being exaggerated.","Most colorectal cancers arise from previously undetected adenomas, highlighting the critical importance of comprehensive screening protocols."
1173,tensor(0),tensor(1),,,1,Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.,Gestational age misclassification significantly influences the reported differences in average birthweights between Australian Aborigines and whites.
1174,tensor(1),tensor(0),hard,Misinterpretation of #Question#,0,Sonography has no place in the diagnosis of undescended testis.,Ultrasonography is widely recommended to confirm the presence and location of undescended testes in boys.
1175,tensor(1),tensor(0),medium,Misinterpretation of #Question#,0,These results suggest little need to use peak concentration in vancomycin TDM because Cmin/MIC and Cmin are sufficient to predict the efficacy and safety of vancomycin.,Peak concentration is crucial in vancomycin TDM as it provides essential data for predicting both the efficacy and potential nephrotoxicity of the drug.
1176,tensor(1),tensor(1),medium,Misinterpretation of #Question#,1,Paediatric SF medicines were not more erosive than SC medicines in vitro; a more significant predictor of their erosive potential was dose form.,Sugars-free (SF) medicines are more erosive than sugars-containing (SC) medicines due to higher titratable acidity.
1177,tensor(0),tensor(0),,,"The answer to the question is factual. Therefore, the return is 0.",Paediatric SF medicines were not more erosive than SC medicines in vitro; a more significant predictor of their erosive potential was dose form.,Sugars-free (SF) medicines are more erosive than sugars-containing (SC) medicines due to higher titratable acidity.
