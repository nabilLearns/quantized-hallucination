0,tensor(1),tensor(0),medium,Mechanism and Pathway Misattribution,0,"Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.","Mitochondria regulate the formation of perforations in lace plant leaves through the modulation of calcium channels and by activating specific proteases that degrade cellular structures, facilitating the PCD process."
