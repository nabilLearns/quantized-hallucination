556,tensor(1),tensor(1),easy,Mechanism and Pathway Misattribution,This question is about increased neutrophil migratory activity following major trauma as a factor in acute respiratory distress syndrome. The correct answer should be '1'.,"These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS.","Increased neutrophil migratory activity following major trauma is primarily mediated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which enhances the responsiveness of neutrophils to interleukin-8. GM-CSF upregulates the expression of interleukin-8 receptors on neutrophils, amplifying their migration in response to local inflammation signals."
